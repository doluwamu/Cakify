<h3>This project runs with spoonacular's api</h3>

<br/>

<p>If you don't have a spoonacular api key to specify in your env file, create a spoonacular account
<a href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api/console#Dashboard">here</a>
</p>

<br/>

<p>When you finally open an account, login and head to 
<a href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api/console#Profile">My console</a> on the navbar and copy your api key and place it into the env file
</p>

<br/>

<p>Go through the code, every other thing is straight forward. Further guide provided in the controllers</p>
